						<p>I designed Huston Hearing's website with Wordpress and created 100% of the content.  I was able to implement the entire design and user experience process for the site.  Starting at the research and interview process, to sketches and wireframing, to information architecture and page flows, and then finally to the final design.

					  	<h2>Huston Hearing Promotional Materials</h2>
						<p>This is actually four separate banners that are supposed to be able to stand on its own, but also be set side-by-side to get the full affect.  The idea was to get a shocking response from the viewer so to make the image unforgettable to envoke more questions.  This is part of a display at trade shows.</p>

					  	<h2>Huston Hearing Promotional Materials</h2>
						<p>This is a decibel chart designed to grab attention and give information to the viewer.  The original purpose was to print this very large in scale to be used as a 'floor mat' to grab attention from people at trade shows.  It proved to be a very successful way to bring people into the booth to talk more about the products.</p>

					  	<h2>Huston Hearing Brochure</h2>
						<p>This is a two-sided brochure.  This brochure was designed with a clean and simple grid look to convey to a third-party physician that Huston Hearing is a professional company that is clean and serious about taking care of their patient's hearing needs.  All future brochures were designed in this format and look to keep brand unity.</p>
